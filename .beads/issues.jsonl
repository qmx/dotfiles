{"id":"nix-r1c","title":"Migrate secrets from git-crypt to pure Nix solution","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrent git-crypt setup requires `--impure` flag for home-manager switch because `secrets.nix` uses `builtins.getEnv \"HOME\"` at evaluation time.\n\n## Research Summary\n\n### Options Evaluated\n\n| Approach | Complexity | Templating | Verdict |\n|----------|------------|------------|---------|\n| agenix | Medium | None built-in | One file per secret, awkward for structured data |\n| sops-nix | High | `${config.sops.placeholder.x}` | Full sops setup, .sops.yaml rules |\n| scalpel | Medium | `\\!\\!PLACEHOLDER\\!\\!` | Works with any backend |\n| Surma's approach | Low | None | Simple age, custom module |\n| envsubst | Low | `${VAR}` | Bad for arrays/complex JSON |\n| **minijinja + age** | Low | `{{ x \\| tojson }}` | Best fit - handles complex structures |\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe problem is reading secrets at **evaluation time** (requires --impure). Solution: decrypt and render templates at **activation time** (pure).\n\n### Chosen Approach: age + minijinja\n\n1. **age** for encryption (like Surma's nixenv) - simple, uses SSH keys\n2. **minijinja** for templating - Rust-based (9MB), has `tojson` filter for valid JSON output\n\n### Current Secret Consumers\n\n1. `secrets.braveApiKey` → env var in opencode module (`modules/home-manager/opencode/default.nix:127`)\n2. `secrets.orthancUrl` → embedded in opencode.json (`hosts/meduseld/home-manager/default.nix:54`)\n3. `secrets.homebridge.*` → complex nested config with cameras array (`hosts/wk3/home-manager/homebridge.nix`)\n\n### Template Example (homebridge)\n\n```jinja\n{\n  \"bridge\": {\n    \"username\": {{ bridge.username | tojson }},\n    \"pin\": {{ bridge.pin | tojson }}\n  },\n  \"cameras\": {{ cameras | tojson }}\n}\n```\n\nThe `tojson` filter handles strings, arrays, objects correctly - outputs valid JSON.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create `modules/secrets/default.nix` - age decryption + minijinja templating module\n2. Create `secrets/` directory with age-encrypted JSON files\n3. Create `templates/` directory with .j2 template files\n4. Migrate each consumer to use templates\n5. Remove git-crypt, delete old secrets.nix\n6. Update flake.nix to remove `secrets` from extraSpecialArgs\n\n## References\n\n- [Surma's nixenv secrets](https://github.com/surma/nixenv/tree/main/secrets)\n- [sops-nix templates](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)\n- [scalpel](https://github.com/polygon/scalpel)\n- [minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja)","notes":"## Decision Log\n\n**Key management decision**: Master age key stored in 1Password (base64 encoded).\n\nAlternatives evaluated and rejected:\n- **age-plugin-yubikey (PIV)**: Touch required for decrypt, doesn't work for remote machines with plugged-in YubiKeys\n- **age-plugin-yubikey (no-touch)**: Security similar to file-based key, adds complexity\n- **age-plugin-gpg**: Not in nixpkgs, requires gpg-agent integration\n- **age-plugin-openpgp-card**: Additional complexity, unclear gpg-agent interaction\n- **Native age SSH support**: Doesn't work with ssh-agent/gpg-agent, requires actual key file\n\nMaster key in 1Password is simplest and meets security requirements.\n\n## Key Setup (one-time)\n\n```bash\n# Generate master age key\nage-keygen -o master.key\n# Output: Public key: age1xxxxxxx...\n\n# Store as base64 in 1Password\ncat master.key | base64\n# Save to 1Password as \"Age Master Key\"\n\n# Delete local copy\nrm master.key\n```\n\n## Per-machine Setup\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/age\necho '\u003cbase64 from 1Password\u003e' | base64 -d \u003e ~/.config/age/keys.txt\nchmod 600 ~/.config/age/keys.txt\n```\n\n## Encrypting Secrets\n\n```bash\n# Public key in secrets/recipients.txt\nage -R secrets/recipients.txt -o secrets/foo.age \u003c plaintext\n```","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:36:58.523779832-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T01:53:46.126254094-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T01:53:46.126254094-05:00"}
